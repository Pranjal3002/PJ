The Segment Anything Model (SAM) produces high quality object masks from input prompts such as points or boxes, and it can be used to generate masks for all objects in an image.
It has been trained on a dataset of 11 million images and 1.1 billion masks, and has strong zero-shot performance on a variety of segmentation tasks

Here’s a breakdown of SAM’s workflow:

Image Embedding: SAM processes the input image using a vision transformer to create an image embedding, capturing relevant information about the objects.
Mask Generation: Based on the embedding, SAM generates a set of object masks. These masks highlight distinct regions in the image that correspond to different objects or segments.
Interactive Refinement: Users can interactively refine these masks by hovering and selecting specific regions.
