## Drawbacks of the SAM Model Implementation

1. **Performance on Complex Backgrounds**:  
   When objects are placed against complex or highly textured backgrounds, the segmentation accuracy may decrease, leading to imperfect object masks.

2. **User Interaction Dependency**:  
   The success of segmentation heavily relies on user input for highlighting objects, which can lead to inconsistencies based on user skill and experience.

3. **Computational Resources**:  
   The SAM model may require significant computational resources, including memory and processing power, which could be a limitation on less powerful machines.

4. **Non-Real-Time Performance**:  
   Depending on the size of the images and the complexity of the scene, the segmentation and shifting operations may not be instantaneous. This could affect user experience in time-sensitive applications.
